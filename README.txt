== Description ==

The Casa Courses plugin is used to connect your Casa installation with your WordPress homepage.

With the plugin installed, you will be able to list all templates and events from Casa on your WordPress site. Depending on the number of available seats on each event, you can allow visitors book seats on your events and the booked participants will be added to your Casa event. They can also be added to a waiting list if you allow that.

The plugin automatically updates all pages generated by the plugin every hour. This is to refresh the number of available seats and also update course descriptions and so on. To make sure this works as intended, it is recommended that you disable caching on the automatically generated pages or make sure that caching is only enabled for an hour.

The source code for the minified javascript and CSS files (present in directories admin/ and public/) are located in the resources/ folder. They are then compiled to the admin/ and public/ directories.

The CSS for the Casa Courses plugin is built on version v5.3.2 of Bootstrap (see https://getbootstrap.com/). The Casa Courses plugin contains a compiled version of bootstrap without any changes.

You can also (optionally) use google fonts, which then will download the fonts from https://fonts.googleapis.com and https://fonts.gstatic.com. Setting the font variable to "Inherit" will however not download anything from google fonts. Terms and conditions can be found [here](https://developers.google.com/fonts/terms)

This plugin uses Google captcha which connects to the following endpoint: https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api.js when verifying captcha requirements. Terms and conditions can be found [here](https://policies.google.com/terms?hl=en).

The plugin is dependent on you having an account and subscription to the [Casa administration platform](https://www.foretagsakademin.se/casa). Without a subscription and an API key to Casa administration platform, the plugin will not work. For terms of subscription please contact [FÃ¶retagsakademin](https://www.foretagsakademin.se/casa).
